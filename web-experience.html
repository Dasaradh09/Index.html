    <h1 id="heading">Diabetic chat bot</h1>

    <p id="Para"> I have created Diabetic chat bot which deals with people who are having
        diabetic. it is so useful in day to day basis as it gives you the accurate results
        when it is used correctly. I'm main agend with this chat bot is to make people aware
        of this uses and how to make better use of this. It's simple to use if you understand 
        the concept. When a person don't know if he/she has a daibetic needs to give the values of sugar 
        levels, then your work is done. chat bot does work for you and give the outputs ad show 
        whether he/she is having diabetic or not. Mostly importanly i have trained this chat 
        bot in way that it can give you prescrption to bring the levels to netural.
